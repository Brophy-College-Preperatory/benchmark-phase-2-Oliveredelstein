        <p>The history of hockey is a fascinating journey, evolving from rudimentary stick-and-ball games played centuries ago to the fast-paced, high-stakes sport we see today. Here’s a look at hockey’s evolution, from its origins to the modern game.</p>
        <p>The sport that resembles modern ice hockey began taking shape in Canada in the 19th century, where British soldiers and immigrants played games on frozen ponds. With long, cold winters and frozen lakes, Canada was the ideal place for ice sports.

            <p>First Recorded Game (1875): The first recorded ice hockey game was held in Montreal on March 3, 1875, at the Victoria Skating Rink. The game had set rules and used a puck instead of a ball, a change that would become standard in ice hockey.</p>
            
            <p>The Influence of James Creighton: James Creighton, a Canadian engineer and sports enthusiast, is often credited with organizing this first game and helping popularize hockey in Canada. Creighton and his friends introduced many of the early rules that helped the game develop structure.</p>
            
            <p>The Evolution of Rules: As the sport grew in popularity, rules were codified to create a more consistent playing experience. By the late 1800s, players wore skates similar to today’s, and the puck was standardized.</p>
